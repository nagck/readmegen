# Node.js: Professional README Generator

## Description
This is a command-line node.js application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. 

In this repository ("README Generator"), I have created a command-line application (as part of my assignment for UofT SCS Coding Boot Camp Course) that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

Technologies Used: JavaScript, Node.js, npm, Inquirer

## Installation

- To install this code, download the zip file and extract the files to a designated directory on your Node.js server without changing the directory/folder structure, or use GitHub's guidelines to clone the repository. 
- Install node.js, npm, Inquirer packages 

## Usage 

The application can be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```
